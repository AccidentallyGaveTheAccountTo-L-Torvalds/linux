Hi Linus, I'm insanely embarrassed, but I accidentally transferred the rights to my account (https://github.com/MensoMG) to you.
I set my account to organization mode and transferred it to you as a "trusted person",
and then I couldn't log in to my account anymore, most likely because my email was unlinked after the transfer. 

Can you give me my account back?
